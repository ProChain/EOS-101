# Agenda

1. What are key pairs
2. Why it's secure
3. What kind of keys is EOS using
4. Signature
5. Conclusion

# What are Key Pairs?

{% highlight bash %}
Private Key: 5J3Aa7Z98cZn9Rjy4aEaYUsN2EmYveLvh4YgCHCvvNB6EYJ94PA
Public Key:  EOS7HZtQrJuKTDF79jmHwSqVT7ff5eZxXmzfSZ91ndS7XW1JwBUkb
{% endhighlight %}

EOS key pairs are generated from elliptic curves.

# What are Key Pairs?

## Elliptic Curves Cryptography (ECC)

y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + ax + b

---

# Why It's Secure?

If your private key is generated from a simple character, like `q`...

... or from a data stream like `10`

[NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology) and [ANSI X9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC_X9) set the minimum key size standard. RSA and DSA is 1024, ECC is 160.

# Why It's Secure?

## secp256k1 vs. secp256r1

Bitcoin uses secp256k1.

Satoshi said secp256k1 is secure for at least 5-10 years, unless there's a breakthrough.

But NIST made secp256r1 a standard curve.(Honeypot?)

# Why It's Secure?

## Dual_EC_DRBG

Honeypot: Const Q in BSAFE.

RSA warns developers not to use the default Dual_EC_DRBG generator in BSAFE.

# Why It's Secure?

So in general purpose, we can believe in secp256k1.

# What kind of keys is EOS using

secp256k1 and secp256r1

# Signature

Here's [an article](http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2011/08/what_is_a_digital_signature.html) talking about it in plain language.

### Before all:

1. Make your public key public.
2. Make your private key private.

### Make people recognize that's you:

1. Sign stuffs with your private key.
2. Other people can decrypt it with your public key, but they can not make a fake one under your name.

### And per se,

1. Other people can use public key to sign data.
2. The one that has the private key can decrypt it.

# Signature

## https (off topic)

### 1

Data: `ProChain is good`

Server -> router_1 -> router_2 -> ... router_BAD ... -> router_n -> your computer

router_BAD: change server's data to: `ProChain is good. Free 10,000 EOS click here.`

### 2

Data: `send 1 USD to Alice`

your computer -> router_1 -> router_2 -> ... router_BAD ... -> router_n -> Server

router_BAD: change your data to: `send 100 USD to Bob`
